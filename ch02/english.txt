Chapter 2.

I've already seen this a minute ago and planned everything. 
When J took the flamethrower and began to pour fire on the house and the policeman with the words: “Haha, you can’t prove that it’s not you!”, 
I secretly walked around him and sneaked out into the courtyards. 
It was necessary to run fast, so I did. 
I have such a feature, when the place and time allow, 
I easily transform my body into something wolf-like and almost fly over the road, drowning in delight. 
Trees, parks, distorted faces of people, who don’t have time to understand what they are seeing - and whoosh, my trace is already gone.
Now I rushed in the same spirit past some homeless man with a stroller. 
The apogee of despondency. 
The thought caught only an awkward silhouette and a hat. 
And suddenly everything broke. 
Despite the clever and light movements of my paws, the treasured gap between the crowns in front - did not come nearer. 
But the nasty homeless from behind - did. 
And for the first time in this ordinary shitty day, I was really scared. 
I don’t even really know what exactly. Still towing somewhere in the middle of the alley, 
I finally thought it would be nice to hide, and from my turtle run I flopped over a boulder on the side of the road.
