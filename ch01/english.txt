Chapter 1.

We were sitting with J at my place and watching movies on my TV. 
Cause J would never spend a penny on any intellectual entertainment. 
So he brought like 5 liters of beer. Without even a bite of food. 
I made sandwiches out of some bread and some butter, salt and parsley. 
And we were stuck in the moment where <movie scene>. 
For some time nothing happened. 
Next thing I know is that J shakes me and says. 
— You’re bleeding. 
I feel a weird itch under the nose and on top of the lips. 
— What …
— You’re bleeding, bro. Nose up, nose up - he pushes my head back 
and I see the this thing on a ceiling - a huge black hole that swirls and winds out and sucks me in
— What a loser - whispers J somewhere from the other street of another city to the whole world
