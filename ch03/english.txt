*Chapter 3.*

I woke up from a massive headache. 
J cleaned up the place real nice. 
I was grateful I didn’t see any of those beers. 
And no trash, including J himself. 
Genius. 
The room was filled with fresh air which I wanted to eat with huge greedy bites. 
Except the headache wouldn’t let me even open the mouth. 
I found the only pill left from those that actually help me and started to chew this bitter poison almost with pleasure. 
Just don’t focus on the pain. Anything else but the pain… 
I drank 1 liter of water and lied in the bed again. 
And then I realized that it was supposed to be Monday. 
Which means I must have been called from work like 100 times by now… 
I turn the phone over terrified to see the time… Of course my phone was dead.
